[kristina_dubai: previous reworked prompt was fucking shit (see notes)]
Actually it wasn't that bad, had just one big issue - very often used incorrect languages.
And upon inspection ChatGPT detected many contradictions, in other words it considered my prompt FUCKING SHIT.

[krsitina_dubai: fix language & repeated question]
It's been 100 time when this shit breaks. 
I disabled all off_topic redirects, including 1st message. And added more rules to enforce same lanuage policy

[kristina_dubai: revert re-asking first question + remove step 5]
I was too lazy to fix formatting or do anything by hand, so I copy-pasted Gemini's adjusted version completely raw.
I didn't even check if it fixed it correctly. I'm too tired.
Might re-visit this commit later to fix formatting and check its validity
